# Microsoft Intune Node

A simple authentication node for ForgeRock's [Identity Platform][forgerock_platform] 6.5.0 and above. This node integrates with Microsoft Intune and Graph API. It allows to evaluate device's compliance posture and return the result. It also allows saving device information (to sharedState object) which can be used by subsequent nodes.


Copy the .jar file from the ../target directory into the ../web-container/webapps/openam/WEB-INF/lib directory where AM is deployed.  Restart the web container to pick up the new node.  The node will then appear in the authentication trees components palette.


##  Configuration properties of the node
#### Header containing Device ID
    We assume that TLS termination takes place before hitting AM. Termination gateway needs to take CN from device certificate presented and put into a header.

#### Azure Tenant ID
   Tenant ID could be in a form of UUID-like string or actual tenant name eg. rocknnroll.onmicrosoft.com.

#### Azure App Registration Application ID
    That is the name of the OAuth2 Client (application) that has been created, given privileges (scopes) to access API data.

#### Azure App Registration Secret
    Has to be created as part of application creation process. Keys -> Passwords section of app configuration.

#### Azure AD User Name
    Intune administrative user name who consented to giving right to the app above.

#### Azure AD User Password
    Above user's password.

#### Do you want to add Device Properties to Shared State
    When accessing GraphApi we’re also extracting some of the most important device characteristics i.e. deviceName, deviceType, operatingSystem, osVersion,deviceRegistrationState, model, manufacturer, serialNumber.
    If this option is enabled all of these characteristics will be put into shared state.

Here's a sample tree with Intune node.
